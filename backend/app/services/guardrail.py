"""No-fabrication enforcement.

Telling a model "do not invent experience" is a request, not a control. This module is
the control: after tailoring, every load-bearing fact in the output must trace back to
something in the user's base resume. Anything that doesn't is a violation.

What we check, and why each one:

  employer / title / institution
      The facts a recruiter verifies first, and the ones that get someone rescinded.
      Must match a base-resume value exactly (after normalization).

  dates
      Stretching an end date to close a gap is the most tempting single edit and the
      easiest to disprove. Must match a base value.

  metrics
      "Improved performance by 40%" when the base said 15% is fabrication even though
      every word around it is true. Every numeric token in the output must appear in the
      base resume.

  skills
      The one place tailoring legitimately surfaces things — but only things already
      present. A skill may be *promoted* from anywhere in the base resume (a bullet, a
      project description); it may not be introduced because the JD asked for it.

Everything else — bullet order, section order, phrasing, the summary — is free. That is
the whole point of tailoring, and none of it asserts a new verifiable fact.

Design note: this is deliberately a whitelist over the base resume rather than a
blocklist of suspicious phrases. A blocklist can only catch fabrications someone
anticipated; a whitelist catches every fabrication by construction, and its failure mode
is a false positive (annoying) rather than a false negative (career damage).
