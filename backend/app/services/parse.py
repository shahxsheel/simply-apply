"""Resume upload → text → structured JSON Resume.

Two stages, deliberately separated:

  1. Extraction (deterministic): PDF/DOCX/TXT → plain text. No model involved, so it
     either works or fails loudly.
  2. Structuring (LLM): text → StructuredResume, schema-constrained by the provider.

The parse is never trusted. The API returns it for the user to review and correct on a
confirm screen before anything is stored as the base resume — every later render and
every guardrail check is anchored to that confirmed document, so an unreviewed parse
error would silently propagate into every application.
